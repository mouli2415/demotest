    <h1>Conclusion of all tags</h1>
    <p>I recently read <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird, </cite>a classic novel that is widely studied in literature classes. In it, a character says, <q>Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.</q>The book also contains a powerful message that is best captured in the following statement:</p>
    <p><blockquote>People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The term <em>courage</em>is often defined in various ways.An example of an abbreviation is <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, which stands for World Health Organization. Meanwhile, <abbr title=" National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> is known for its space missions.In programming, a simple JavaScript line might look like this: <kbd>let x = 10;</kbd> To run a command, you might press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> on your keyboard. Sometimes,it's important to <em>emphasis </em>certain words for effect, but if something is no longer relevant, it can be marked with <del>strikethrough.</del>When new information is added,it can be marked with <ins>an insertion.</ins> Text of particular importance can be marked with <strong>strong emphasis</strong>. In mathematics a <em>variable</em> might be denoted by a letter like x or y.An example of a system message might be: <samp>Operation completed successfully.</samp> Finally,you can reach me at my <br><em>123 Main St, Springfield, USA</em></p></body>
